    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Why should I use Daimyo and not Samurai API directly?</h3>
    <p>If you want to use the API directly, sure. I won't stand in your way. In fact it may be a good idea to first try the raw API, just to get a feel of how badly you want to use Daimyo!</p>
    <h3>Is Daimyo PCI compliant?</h3>
    <p>No. Daimyo itself is not atested for PCI-compliance, but you can use Samurai (and Daimyo) in ways that make PCI irrelevant for you.And you don't want to know what I think of PCI. Also, Daimyo is quite new so it should not be considered otherwise secure yet. When it reaches version 0.1, though, it should be pretty secure and battle-tested.</p>
    <h3>So what DO you think about PCI?</h3>
    <p>Next question!</p>
    <h3>Does it mean that Daimyo is not secure?</h3>
    <p>I try to make it as secure as I know how to, but no, it currently shouldn't be considered safe. It hasn't been tested enough, and there are plenty of holes that can potentially be exploited (maybe not directly, but through a bug in your app). So, when Daimyo learns to defend against <em>your</em> mistakes (e.g., the new configuration locking mechanism), as well as <em>mine</em>, we can both rejoice and consider Daimyo safe.</p>
    <h3>Should I use the pre-release version?</h3>
    <p>Only if you're retarded. Seriously, though. No, please don't use the pre-release version and come to me with a story of lost millions in profit and reputation. I push all kinds of shitty code (pardon me, but I could not find a better term) and then come back later and fix it. And if you use the shitty version, well... bad timing. So you should generally stick to slightly less shitty release versions.
    <h3>But pre-release version has this awesome feature X!</h3>
    <p>Yes, it sure does. Next question!</p>
    <h3>Where can I get Daimyo?</h3>
    <p>You can get Daimyo <a href="http://search.npmjs.org/#/daimyo">via npm</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/HerdHound/Daimyo">via GitHub</a>
    <h3>I found a bug!</h3>
    <p>Hey, thanks for that! Please report it in the <a href="https://github.com/HerdHound/Daimyo/issues">issue tracker</a>. When filing a bug, please try to include as much information as possible. Most helpful information is the piece of code that triggered the error, maybe a small test app (or even better, a unit test!), and your configuration. Oh, and don't forget the exact error message.</p>
    <h3>I want feature X. Can I file an issue for that?</h3>
    <p>Yes, please!</p>
    <h3>I have some personal issues. Can I file that as well?</h3>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h3>But it <em>is</em> an issue tracker isn't it?</h3>
    <p>Next question!</p>
    <h3>I have a patch. Can I send you a pull request?</h3>
    <p>Only if it has inline documentation and tests that actually pass. Nah. That was just to scare you. But seriously, tests and docs would be highly appreciated. Also, indent the code with 2 spaces, not 4, and no tabs please. Anyway, take a look at my code and you'll get the idea of what's required.</p>
